description: "A brief report on the num2words PyPI supply-chain compromise that distributed Scavenger malware. It details how a malicious update (v0.5.15 and v0.5.16) injected Windows DLL-loading code into __init__.py, executing the Scavenger Loader which connects to new C2 servers, steals .pypirc credentials, and downloads stealer modules. Includes IoCs, C2 info, and credits to researchers who discovered and analyzed the breach."
